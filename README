This is a work-in-progress implementation of the Kademlia DHT network in python.

The design makes use of eventlet's queues and uses them as one might use
channels in go. This allows for a structure where the low level RPC's and
the higher level Kad functions can exist in separate layers.

The higher level functions are implemented in a blocking manner, though many of
them could be run in separate coroutines.


Implemented so far:

* Routing table with accelerated lookups
* Simulated Network Layer for testing
* RPCS:
    * FIND_NODE
    * FIND_VALUE
    * STORE
    * PING (though not used)
* Routing table unit tests
* test script
